Feature: Intent Results Are Correctly Delivered

  Background: 
    Given "libraryApp" is an app with the following intents
      | Intent Name | Context Type | Result Type |
      | returnBook  | fdc3.book    | {empty}     |
    And A newly instantiated FDC3 Server
    And "LibraryApp/l1" is opened

  Scenario: App Returns An Intent Response
    When "App1/a1" raises an intent for "returnBook" with contextType "fdc3.book" on app "LibraryApp/l1" with requestUuid "ABC123"
    When "LibraryApp/l1" sends a raiseIntentResponse for intent "StartChat" with requestUuid "ABC123"
    Then messaging will have outgoing posts
      | msg.type            | msg.meta.requestUuid | to.appId | to.instanceId |
      | raiseIntentResponse | ABC123               | App1     | a1            |
