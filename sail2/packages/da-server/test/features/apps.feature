      | msg.type         | msg.payload.channelId | msg.payload.context.type | to.instanceId |
      | openResponse     | {empty}               | {empty}                  | a1            |

      | findInstancesResponse |                                 0 | a1            |

  Scenario: Find Instances with Some Apps Running

    Then messaging will have outgoing posts
      | msg.type              | msg.payload.appIdentifiers.length | msg.payload.appIdentifiers[0].instanceId | msg.payload.appIdentifiers[1].instanceId | to.instanceId |
      | findInstancesResponse |                                 2 | a1                                       | b1                                       | li            |
