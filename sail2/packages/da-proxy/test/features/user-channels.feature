Background: Desktop Agent API
    Given A Desktop Agent in "api"
    Given "instrumentMessageOne" is a "broadcastRequest" message on channel "one" with context "fdc3.instrument" 
    Given "countryMessageOne" is a "broadcastRequest" message on channel "one" with context "fdc3.country"
    
    Scenario: List User Channels    

        There should be a selection of user channels to choose from

        When I call "api" with "getUserChannels"
        Then "{result}" is an array of objects with the following contents
            | id    | type              | displayMetadata.color         |
            | one   | user              | red                           |
