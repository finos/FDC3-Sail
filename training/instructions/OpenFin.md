# Using OpenFin For the Training Course

1. Use https://start.openfin.co, enter the manifest location and generate an installer. If you have the training apps running, then the correct URL is:

http://localhost:5000/static/opt/OpenFin/manifest.json

2. Run the installer - it will download the necessary OpenFin binaires.

3. Start OpenFin (if it doesn't start automatically) and at the prompt where it says "what would you like to do?" enter "tradelist"

4. The tradelist app will start up.
